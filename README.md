Hi guys.

Added AeroInsta Settings 》Verified account 》**Custom blue tick URL address** option with AeroInsta With this option, you can define your own blue tick (verified badge) URL for AeroInsta and share this URL with your friends. The Instagram accounts you specify will be blue tick (verifed badge) for anyone using your URL.

**How can I generate a URL?**

1. Register on Github by clicking [here](https://github.com/signup).

2. After registration, create a new project by clicking [here](https://github.com/new):

<div align="center">

[<img src="https://github.com/AeroInstagram/Verified/blob/main/Assets/SS01.png" width="" height="">](https://github.com/ikx7a)

</div>

After typing the name of your project (you can write whatever you want), click the green button named "**Create repository**".

3. Click the "**creating a new file**" button on the next screen.

<div align="center">

</div>

4. Enter a name that ends with ".json". I have named `ikx7a.json` as an example.

In the large space just below, write the usernames you want the blue tick (verified badge) to appear, such as `["ikx7.a","ijerryy_","kx.writer"]`

You can write as much as you want, for example:
`["ikx7.a","ijerryy_","kx.writer"]`

You can view the sample URL by clicking [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ikx7a/Verified/main/ikx7a.json).

After you have finished writing, click the green button named "Commit new file".
